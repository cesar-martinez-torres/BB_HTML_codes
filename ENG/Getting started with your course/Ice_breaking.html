  <p>
    During the first laboratory session, you will have approximately <strong>20 minutes</strong> to get to know
    the other students enrolled in the course. The objective is to identify personal affinities, shared academic
    or career interests, and compatible schedules.
  </p>

  <p>
    This activity will help you become familiar with your classmates and make an informed decision about
    who you will work with during the laboratory sessions throughout the semester.
